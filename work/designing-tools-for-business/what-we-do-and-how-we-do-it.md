There are plenty of resources and materials describing UX process on the web, but it’s important to describe the role this process should play within an organisation to get the most value.

The quality of work we produce is due to the team of creative thinkers we have brought together. 100 Shapes is an organisation of user researchers, visual designers, interaction designers, information architects and developers. Each of these roles are specialists at conduct or crafting a particular part of a typical, well-implemented, UX design process. 

Our role is to know when to deploy and leverage these resources, and decide how they can be used on your project to produce outputs and deliverables that that will drive it forward at that moment in time.

There’s isn’t a “one-size fits all” in system design. Every project needs to be properly understood before we can identify how to proceed with the designers and budgets at hand. However, there are certain aspects to the process which remain constant, and it’s these areas that ensure the consistency of output quality, and give us the confidence to approach your organisation confident that we’ll be able to deliver great work.
