                Our aim is to improve the experience of employees by designing
                and developing internal business tools which are optimised to
                help them do their jobs. Our projects have shown that taking
                this approach leads of efficiency gains within the organisation
                saving time, money and costs.

                With ITV, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in productivity of the
                GE Ops team as a result of <a href="./ITV-Craft/">ITV Craft</a>
                which removed training costs and reduced an 8 minute process,
                repeated 30 times a day by each team member, down to 30 seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within retail and fashion, we’ve helped high-end fashion brand
                Burberry <a href="./Burberry-Transparency/">identify bottlenecks
                    in their process of getting new items ready for sale online</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our design expertise help recognise inefficient workflows and
                then design the business systems, UIs and processes to change them for the better.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do this by putting your staff at the centre of
                the design process because we believe that happier employees and
                better designed business tools mean more efficient businesses.
