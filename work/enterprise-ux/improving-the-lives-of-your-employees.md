The day-to-day reality of work for many of us is a sedentary one. Our bodies fixed in an upright position; our minds focused on completing the task in hand.

We spend X number of hours a week working at our computers and for many of us a large proportion of that time is spent using business software of some description.

Business software, enterprise software, internal tools – whatever you call it – are the necessary tools people use all day and everyday to do their jobs. They enable the delivery of vital information, critical communications and essential process that run a company. They are the buttons, forms and fields we click, crank and occasionally thump in order to get work done and keep a business running.

And - unfortunately for the millions of people that depend on them - they are more often than not ugly, outdated and painfully slow to operate.


## Design is an optimisation

Many companies are beginning to recognise the vital role that design can play in improving the efficiency of a company. Well known brands such as Air Bnb and Uber see design as an inherent part of their service, understanding the value good design brings in understanding your customers and employees.

Companies are recognising the value that well designed systems and services can bring to their business from increasing efficiency, data quality and ultimately saving money.

But the benefits are more far reaching than that. Well designed business tools can improve the lives of the people sat using them day in day out in a fundamental way. 

Tools that have been designed with a deep understanding of the end user can help them not only increase their efficiency and efficacy but help them learn new skills, give them a greater sense of confidence in their role within an organisation and dare we say it, spend less time in front of their screen.

At 100 Shapes we believe well designed business tools play a vital role in improving the lives of the people that matter most to an organisation - the employees that run it.

Well designed business tools should help people:

## Learn and progress
 
A well designed system shouldn’t simply allow a person to get their work done, it should teach them new skills, to develop their role and ultimately support their career development.

As designers we must understand the intricacies of their role, the minute tasks they carry out and provide experiences that not only improve the speed at which they can be performed but also present notifications, helpful documentation and support that endeavours to continuously develop their understanding of their role.

Ultimately people shouldn’t just learn how a system works, they should grow in confidence to make it work for them.


## Be more efficient and effective

In the consumer world we often look for ways of keeping people browsing or lingering as long as possible within an app or experience. Designing in the business space is the opposite. We’re looking for ways of reducing the time it takes to carry out a task whilst maintaining or enhancing the activity. They must be predictable and accurate.

Reduce the waste of time spend as well as financial waste.

## Simplify the complex

Businesses technologies and processes are intrinsically complicated. They require people with different levels of expertise to ensure they run smoothly. Business tools must enable employees with different skillsets to carry out their jobs, but needn’t overwhelm. They should enable employees with a certain level of skill carry out their jobs as well as provide advance controls to the experts.

## Handing back control

The sum of all this is allows employees to feel empowered by the tools they use to do their jobs, rather than shackled by them, reducing the significant amount of wasted time (and money), handing back control and allowing people to lead happier more rewarding lives at work and achieve career greatness!
