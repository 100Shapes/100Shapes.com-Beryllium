## The value of a UX process

### 1. Increased productivity

Our design process streamlines your tools. By understanding your company needs and designing “smart” tools we can help users to eliminate repetitive, mundane or error prone tasks - achieving the same output while reducing keystrokes, clicks and ultimately time taken.


### 2. Increased user adoption

Designing tools which are a ‘pleasure to use’ can hugely affect the traction of new software in large organisations. When users feel a tool genuinely helps them in their day to day work or saves them time, they are much more likely to use and recommend it.


### 3. Reduced user errors/increased data quality

Humans make mistakes, well designed tools can minimise the user input and check everything (with the user) at the input stage, before the problem escalates. Uncaught input errors can hugely affect the running cost of a large corporation from having to make additional compliance workflows to time spent correcting and firefighting growing problems, or other catastrophic cases: [Mars Climate Orbiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#Cause_of_failure)


### 4. Decreased training and support costs

Intuitive or “Easy to use” software reduces the need for expensive or “tied in” training. Benefit include smaller training teams and less time out for your staff. Training budgets are usually proportional to user interface complexity.

reduced requirements for large support teams.

5. Decreased development times and costs
6. Decreased maintenance costs
7. Increased user satisfaction

## Calculating ROI
Weinschenk, in her white paper Usability: A Business Case , outlines three useful equations for calculating cost savings related to:

### Errors

- (# of errors) x (avg. repair time) x (employee cost) x (# of employees) = cost savings
- _Example: (2 errors/week) x (60 mins) x ($30/hour) x (100 employees) = $6,0000/week or **$300,000/year**_
    
### Cost of Development and Maintenance

- (# of changes) x (avg. hrs/change) x (cost of developer) x (4, if late) = cost savings
- _Example: (20 changes) x (8 hrs each) x ($40/hour) = $6,400 if fixed early or **$25,600** if changed late_

### Productivity

- (time saved) x (employee cost) x (# of employees) = cost savings
- _Example: (1 hr/week) x ($30/hr) x (1000 employees) = $30,000/ week or **$15,000,000/year**_
