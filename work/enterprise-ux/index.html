            Good system design isn’t just what an interface looks like. Systems and tools work measurably better when
            designed around the needs of their users. Companies who put their staff as well as their business objectives
            at the heart of the design process see

            For any organisation, the most efficient systems are those that align with the way staff really work. By
            making tasks intuitive and simple, user-focused tools are naturally optimised to maximise work rates and
            minimise errors and ad-hoc fixes.
