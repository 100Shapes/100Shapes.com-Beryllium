  Anti-Slavery policy for 100 Shapes
---

V1.0

Effective date 10/2011

This policy applies to all persons working for us or on our behalf in any capacity, including employees at all levels, directors, officers, contractors and suppliers.

100 Shapes Ltd strictly prohibits the use of modern slavery and human trafficking in our operations. We have and will continue to be committed to implementing systems and controls aimed at ensuring that modern slavery is not taking place anywhere within our organisation. We expect that our suppliers will hold their own suppliers to the same high standards.

## Commitments

### Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking
Modern slavery is a term used to encompass slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour, bonded and child labour and human trafficking. Human trafficking is where a person arranges or facilitates the travel of another person with a view to that person being exploited. Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights.

### Commitments
We shall be a company that expects everyone working with us or on our behalf to support and uphold the following measures to safeguard against modern slavery:

- We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery in our organisation.
- The prevention, detection and reporting of modern slavery in any part of our organisation is the responsibility of all those working for us or on our behalf. Workers must not engage in, facilitate or fail to report any activity that might lead to, or suggest, a breach of this policy.
- We are committed to engaging with our shareholders and suppliers to address the risk of modern slavery in our operations.
- We take a risk based approach to our contracting processes and keep them under review. We assess whether the circumstances warrant the inclusion of specific prohibitions against the use of modern slavery and trafficked labour in our contracts with third parties. 
- If we find that other individuals or organisations working on our behalf have breached this policy we will ensure that we take appropriate action. This may range from considering the possibility of breaches being remediated and whether that might represent the best outcome for those individuals impacted by the breach to terminating such relationships
