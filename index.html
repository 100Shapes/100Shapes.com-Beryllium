                100 Shapes are a user experience (UX) &amp; digital design
                studio based in London UK. We specialise in the design, prototyping
                and development of bespoke enterprise business systems; creating
                internal business tools to help large organisation run more productively.
            </p>
            <p>
                We help identify inefficient workflows and processes within large organisations
                and design systems and tools to change them for the better. We do this
                by putting staff at the centre of the design process because we understand
                that happier employees and better designed business tools mean
                more efficient businesses.
            </p>
