            <p>
                100 Shapes are an enterprise UX ('user experience') &amp; design agency focused
                on designing enterprise software and business apps for better
                business performance; helping large organisations run more productively.
            </p>
            <p>
                We help identify inefficient workflows and processes within large organisations
                and create business architectures and enterprise tools to change them for the better.
                We do this by putting staff at the centre of the design process because we understand
                that happier employees and better designed business apps mean more efficient businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Can we help with a business application?
