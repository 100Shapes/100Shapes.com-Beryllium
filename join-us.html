<p>Founded by Chris Elphick and brothers Michele and Paolo&nbsp;Memoli, 100&nbsp;Shapes has always been driven
    by a shared
    energy, curiosity and passion for design.</p>

<p>Today we’re an award-winning multi-disciplinary team of designers, researchers and front-end developers.
    We’re
    tinkerers, experimenters and creators, with no hard boundaries between work and play.
</p>

<p>Our mission is to create an open, collaborative environment where we can explore our craft and deliver our
    best work.
    As a team we’re close and supportive, making our studio a fertile ground for ideas and growth. Sometimes the
    things
    we make launch whole new ventures and businesses.
</p>

<p>100 Shapes is located in the beating heart of Camden, North London. Our clients include household names like
    ITV, the
    BBC, London Live, Radio 3 and Yale University.
</p>

<p>We nurture fresh talent and always want to know about clever, creative people out there who are as dedicated to great user experiences and design as we are. Check out the roles we typically look for below.</p>
