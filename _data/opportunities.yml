    We're always on the look-out for Interaction Designers with attention to detail; who want to change the world
    around them because they can spot better ways of interacting with the tools and systems they encounter every day.

    If you're interested in working with us, send us your portfolio and focus on projects which describe _why_ you
    made certain decisions – that's what we're really interested in.

    Building for the web is an ever evolving and wide reaching craft. We look developers who appreciate who are using the latest tech but respect the value in reducing the number of parts in a system.

    We look for developers who are a bit confused by the word programmer.

    We look for developers who have have npm war stories.

    We look for developers who have advanced font features.

    We look for developers who have something to say about systemd.

    Some of the tools we like to use:

    - React with Redux
    - PostCSS and Sass
    - Webpack and Gulp
    - JavaScript ES2015 with Babel
    - Django / Python a bonus
    - Docker / Linux / MacOS

    Build design systems expressed through CSS.
