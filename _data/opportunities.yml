    We're always on the look-out for Interaction Designers with attention to detail; who want to change the world
    around them because they can spot better ways of interacting with the tools and systems they encounter every day.

    If you're interested in working with us, send us your portfolio and focus on projects which describe _why_ you
    made certain decisions – that's what we're really interested in.

    As a visual designer at 100 Shapes you will be responsible for creating appropriate, clean interfaces,
    compositions and graphic pieces. You’ll breathe life into wireframes, design bold identities for bold
    companies and be given the chance to explore your art in directions you didn’t think you could. We’re keen
    believers that one design problem can have many right answers.

    We like to be hands on with our projects, utilising your skills as a designer, whether sketching or perfecting
    a mobile layout. You’ll work side by side our developers, user researchers and fellow designers as well as
    getting stuck in to client-facing workshops. Drop us an email and link to your website/dribbble portfolio.

    digital products that provide value to users.

    We’re always interested in meeting User Researchers who are approachable, analytical thinkers,
    and who take ownership of their findings through to design and development stages.

    Building for the web is an ever evolving and wide reaching craft. We look developers who appreciate who are
    using the latest tech but respect the value in reducing the number of parts in a system.

    We look for developers who are a bit confused by the word programmer.
    We look for developers who have have npm war stories.
    We look for developers who have advanced font features.
    We look for developers who have something to say about systemd.
    Some of the tools we like to use:

    - React with Redux
    - PostCSS and Sass
    - Webpack and Gulp
    - JavaScript ES2015 with Babel
    - Django / Python a bonus
    - Docker / Linux / MacOS
    - Build design systems expressed through CSS.
