100 Shapes site â€“ "Beryllium" release
=====================================

Static site generated with Jekyll.

`master` branch contains content and template files. [`travis`](https://travis-ci.org/100Shapes/100Shapes.com-Beryllium) builds the site and pushes to the `gh-pages` branch.

To Do
-----

- Migrate over content
    - Copy and paste content
    - Pull over media
    - Update `aliases` of each file


Development
-----------

run `./scripts/dev`. This will start a Jekyll server in watch mode.

Note: if you change config, you may have to restart.


Deploy
------

You don't deploy, [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/100Shapes/100Shapes.com-Beryllium) does. Just push to master and it does the rest.
