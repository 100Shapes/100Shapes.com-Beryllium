A TV channel for London backed by the Evening  Standard & the Independent. 
We defined the entire online presence, including how the online platform brings together live and catch-up TV, programme listings, news, travel, weather and social media into an engaging cross platform user experience.

In order to decide what was required we carried out an in-depth  audience research study, prototyping…
From rough sketches to high-fidelity  HTML prototypes, we tested assumptions throughout the project

In 2014, we were commissioned to design the London Live website – the  accompanying site to a new TV channel for London backed by the Evening  Standard & the Independent.  The initial brief was vague and largely driven by technical requirements. In order to  clarify the objectives, and reflect the needs of the wider business, we conducted  stakeholder interviews.  Crucially though, to identify genuine user needs we carried out an in-depth  audience research study with 10 participants spanning London Live’s target  demographic.  We assembled a team of user researchers, user experience designers and  information architects to deliver the project with a user-centered approach.

Up front, we ran an in-depth, audience research study with 10 participants  based on a target demographic. The study examined the potential opportunities  to fit into the lives of the audience members by understanding how well they  were served for certain types of information such as news, travel, weather and  entertainment.  By understanding where participants were under-served, and comparing that to  what was important, we were able to identify the biggest opportunities for London  Live and inform the design direction. Armed with insight from the business and  target users, our designers began to generate ideas and the research planned the  tests.  To ensure the product was developed with its end users in mind, our researchers  scheduled sessions on a weekly basis to test the designs as they were produced.  Prior to each round, we agreed a set of testing objectives and prepared a script  that was shared with the wider project team. From rough sketches to high-fidelity  HTML prototypes, we tested assumptions with the stimuli that the designers had  at that point in the project.  Each session was conducted by a user researcher accompanied by a member of  the design team to spread knowledge of the findings and help compile a report  that was subsequently published on the project wiki for the team to discuss and  review. The project ran for 4 months with testing conducted throughout.
