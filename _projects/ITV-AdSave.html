  ITV AdSave showed ITV how it could build a relationship with the viewer that offered genuine value on the
  customer’s terms, unlike the one-way broadcast of an ad.

            ITV’s commercial department wanted to make marketing messages within its online TV service more relevant and
            useful. In response, 100 Shapes developed Ad Save, a tool that allowed viewers to save and collect offers to
            a ‘wallet’ within ITV Player, and redeem them across all devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            We designed and built a working prototype and tested it in a live pilot within the real ITV Player
            interface. Targeted audiences were genuinely receptive to the personalised wallet experience and the
            perceived increase in relevance of the interactive ads.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following successful usability testing we held a presentation and future-applications workshop with senior
            ITV stakeholders, demonstrating a range of use cases for interactive ads and how they could form a key
            element of ITV’s future customer engagement strategy.
