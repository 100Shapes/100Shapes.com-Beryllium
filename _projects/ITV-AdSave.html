  ITV AdSave allowed the broadcaster to build relationship with its viewers through the ITV Player
  by offering genuine value on the customer’s terms, unlike the one-way broadcast of an ad.

        <p>
            ITV’s Commercial department wanted to make marketing messages
            within its online TV service more relevant and useful to their intended audiences.
            These marketing messages were displayed to users of the ITV player before their show
            started on the ITV Player.
        </p>
        <p>
            In response to this brief, 100 Shapes created <em>Ad Save</em>,
            a widget that allowed viewers to save and collect offers from popular brands
            to a virtual ‘wallet’ within ITV Player, and redeem them across all devices when in-store.
        </p>
        <p>
            100 Shapes designed and built a working prototype and tested it in a live pilot within the real ITV Player
            interface. Targeted audiences were genuinely receptive to the personalised wallet experience and the
            perceived increase in relevance of the interactive ads.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following successful usability testing we held a presentation and future-applications workshop with senior
            ITV stakeholders, demonstrating a range of use cases for interactive ads and how they could form a key
            element of ITV’s future customer engagement strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The outcomes from the creative workshop were used to plan further development of the Ad Save concept in the future.
