Improving advertising in ITV Player 
Looking for different ways of engaging audiences through advertising, ITV asked 100 Shapes to define and design how to make advertising ‘more useful’ within ITV Player.  100 Shapes worked closely with ITV’s advertising innovations team to develop a multi-platform experience that included new interactive ad formats, a personalised advertising….   

A user-centred approach 
ITV’s audience played a central role in the design process. Members of the target audience tested the designs and prototypes throughout the duration of the project to inform the experience and assess the desirability of the offering.  Working with the business 100 Shapes devised and ran workshops with ITV stakeholders from across their Online, Commercial and Technology teasms to gain their buy-in and identify opportunities for how the project could meet their own objectives. 
 
Fully integrated
100 Shapes created a fully function prototype integrated into. Interactive ads are a great example of taking the traditional tv advertising model and applying new technologies that makes the format more entertaining, useful and relevant for audiences.
