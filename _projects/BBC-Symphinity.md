If you’re a fan of the odd classical tune but feel a bit daunted by the sheer breadth of choice on offer, BBC Symphinity can help. Each week you’ll find a new collection of compositions connected by a simple, sometimes curious theme. You can enjoy some well-known classics or forgotten gems, whilst BBC Symphinity presents you with short passages and excerpts about the composers and their music.
