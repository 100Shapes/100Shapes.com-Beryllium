            Yale University Press has an impressive archive of scholarly art and architectural history material. At the
            time we were approached much of it was held in digital format, but the interface for accessing the resources
            was clunky and confusing. This rendered the valuable digital materials inaccessible and consequently,
            tragically underused.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our brief was to unlock its potential and open it up to a broad audience in line with Yale’s core mission of
            expanding and sharing knowledge. We answered this brief with a bespoke app that unlocked the potential of the
            archive in an easy and accessible way.
        </p>
        <p>
            We worked with developers Librios to create an intuitive, easy-to-use platform for desktop and tablet that
            allowed students and staff to find, excerpt and compile relevant material for later reading. We developed a
            visual style and interface that would fit into and enhance the treasured heritage brand and deliver a
            beautiful online reading experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the design process we ran regular, iterative usability testing of the user interface (UI) to ensure
            that our designs were consistently meeting the needs of the target users. These testing sessions took place before
            we delivered designs to the tech teams for development.
        </p>
        <p>
            The usability testing of the prototype has been extremely positive and Yale University Press is now
            in the process of considering how and when Istoria might be launched to the public.
