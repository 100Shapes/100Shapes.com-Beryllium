            Yale University Press has an impressive archive of scholarly art and architectural history material. At the
            time we were approached much of it was held in digital format, but the interface was clunky and confusing,
            leaving a highly valuable resource underused. Our brief was to unlock its potential and open it up to a
            broad audience in line with Yale’s core mission of expanding and sharing knowledge.

            We worked with developers Librios to create an intuitive, easy-to-use platform for desktop and tablet that
            allowed students and staff to find, excerpt and compile relevant material for later reading. We developed a
            visual style and interface that would fit into and enhance the treasured heritage brand and deliver a
            beautiful online reading experience. Usability testing of the prototype has been extremely positive and Yale
            UP is now considering how and when Istoria might be launched.
