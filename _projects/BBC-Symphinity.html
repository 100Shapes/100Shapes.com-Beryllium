            Unknown to most classical devotees, the BBC has a vast digital library of world-class classical recordings.
            Radio 3 wanted to increase online engagement among its fanbase and also tap into a new community of Radio 4
            listeners: people interested in but unsure how to approach the world of classical music.

            100 Shapes won a commission to develop our original BBC Symphinity concept, an app serving up playlists
            curated by Radio 3 experts around a range of engaging themes. Each track was accompanied by snippets of
            information about the piece, its composer and its historical significance.

            The BBC Symphinity pilot featured on the BBC Taster innovation platform for three months. It was tried by
            well over 2000 listeners and shared by one in five. BBC Symphinity was welcomed by BBC stakeholders as a
            simple, inexpensive way to repurpose existing content, add depth to the listener experience and increase
            audience reach.
