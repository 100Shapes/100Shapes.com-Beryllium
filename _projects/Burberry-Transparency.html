            From a designer’s work top to the shop floor, the process of managing new stock is vital to the success of
            Burberry’s business. Our brief was to take a process previously managed via spreadsheets and coordinated on
            shared-network drives and catapult it into the digital-cloud age.
        </p>
        <p>
            100 Shapes prototyped a new workflow using a custom built business tool which provided better visibility of
            the process, top-level statistics for managers on a dashboard view, and tasks lists for individuals to track
            stock that's arriving and passing-through the process.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project is ongoing as we’re beginning to explore wider parts of the business to find further
            opportunities to optimise the process.
