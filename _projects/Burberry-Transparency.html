            The process of coordinating new lines as they go from the designer's concept to sampling,
            sampling to a photoshoot and managing all of the descriptive copy that's required for
            online sale is vital to the success of Burberry's business.

            The brief for 100 Shapes was to take a process previously managed via spreadsheets
            and coordinated on shared-network drives and catapult it into the digital-cloud age by
            designing a bespoke enterprise system that would do as much of the manual workflow management
            as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            100 Shapes prototyped a new workflow by designing bespoke software that
            provided better visibility of the entire process, top-level statistics for senior managers
            via a dashboard view, and tasks lists for individuals which allowed them to track items
            as they passed-through the pipeline.
        </p>
        <p>
            The additional visibility of this digital merchandising process helped business accountability
            by providing an audit log of who did what, and the overview pages allow senior members
            of the team to identify the bottlenecks in the workflow.

            The project is ongoing as we continuing to explore the requirements of the various teams involved
            and develop additional functionality of the tool. We're also in the process of exploring wider parts
            of the business to find further opportunities to optimise the process.
