        <p>
            Our brief was to review and fix a convoluted, time-consuming production and approval
            process between creative, marketing, scheduling and legal teams across multiple simultaneous campaigns.
        </p>
        <p>
            An embedded 100 Shapes team worked closely with ITV to design a simple, accessible promo database.
            By creating a ‘single source of truth’ with an integrated push email system, we were able to dramatically
            simplify workflows and reduce user clicks, double-ups and error rates.

            The project increased efficiency so markedly that ITV no longer needed to employ additional staff in busy
            seasons, delivering substantial cost savings to the business. The system won ITV’s 2016 Technical Supplier
            for Innovation and Design Award.
