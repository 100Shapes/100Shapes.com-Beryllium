With more than 6 hours of daily live news and entertainments programming, interactive screens have transformed the way London Live’s presenters communicate with their audiences. 100 Shapes devised and designed a suite of interactive big screen applications for presenters to clearly communicate news, travel, weather and social content at a moment’s notice. 

## Cleverly integrated  
The real-time data is powered by the same systems as London Live’s website, reducing the need for unnecessary editorial amends and ensuring a consistent message across platforms.  

## Intuitive admin  
Required to display real-time data instantly, the interactive display showcases live news, weather and travel data with minimal set-up. London Live’s presenters use an intuitive admin to quickly set up and create highly visual presentations.
