  It was an epic task with a tough deadline: to design and create London Live’s entire
  digital presence (responsive web, on-screen TV graphics and in-studio interactive displays)
  in time for a looming – and non-negotiable – go-live date.

            London Live was a new local TV channel backed by the Evening Standard
            and Independent newspapers. Its mandate was to provide regional and topical
            broadcasting for the area of London, focusing specifically on live content.

            100 Shapes were engaged to design an enterprise system to
            deliver their entire digital platform including a responsive website, on-screen
            TV graphics and in-studio interactive display screens. The website alone provided
            the full spectrum of their content offering – news, weather, entertainment, sport,
            programme listings, social media, live and on-demand TV – to their audiences.

            100 Shapes followed a rigorous UX &amp; design process which began with a detailed
            research phase: we worked closely with sample audiences to research genuine user
            consumption behaviours and expectations. While our UX designers produced sketches
            and wireframes of the interface, our visual designers adapted the already-developed
            broadcast brand for online use and developed a flexible, future-safe design across
            desktop, mobile and responsive formats. We also built a new tool for curating and
            moderating ‘hyperlocal’ Twitter streams – the basis for our later <a href="http://climb.social/">Climb.social</a>
            tool – and delivered the whole new digital platform right on time for launch.
