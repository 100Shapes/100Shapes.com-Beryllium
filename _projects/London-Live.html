  It was an epic task with a tough deadline: to design and create London Live’s entire digital presence in time for a
  looming – and not-negotiable – go-live date.

            London Live was a new local TV channel backed by the Evening Standard and Independent newspapers. Our brief
            was to translate its complete content offering – news, weather, entertainment, sport, programme listings,
            social media, live and on-demand TV – to the web.</p>
        <p>
            100 Shapes worked closely with sample audiences to research genuine user consumption behaviours and
            expectations. We adapted the already-developed broadcast brand for online use and developed a flexible,
            future-safe design across desktop, mobile and responsive formats. We also built a new tool for curating and
            moderating ‘hyperlocal’ Twitter streams – the basis for our later <a href="http://climb.social/">Climb.social</a>
            tool – and delivered the whole new digital platform right on time for launch.
