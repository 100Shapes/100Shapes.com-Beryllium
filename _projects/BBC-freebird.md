- The BBC developed an algorithm that analyses content from across the web.
- They challenged 100 Shapes to transform this rich data into something meaningful for BBC audiences and ensure that it upholds the BBC’s gold standard in breadth, depth, balance and revelation.
- 100 Shapes developed a prototype using real data from the BBC database. It displayed music news pulled from publications across the web.
- I allows audiences to quickly interpret whether the content is mostly positive or negative, whether it’s a quick read or something longer.
- It maintains a sense of balance by displaying different articles on the same topic, but with polarising opinions alongside each other.
- 100 Shapes defined a visual language to differentiate external content from the voice of the BBC
- Having developed a powerful new algorithm that analyses content from across the web, the BBC challenged 100 Shapes to illustrate the value of displaying external content on their website.
