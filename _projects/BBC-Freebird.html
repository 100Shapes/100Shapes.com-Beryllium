            The decision to feature external music reviews and articles on its own branded platform was a major
            departure for the BBC. As a trusted resource on the internet, it is imperative that it maintains
            balance when reporting and presenting content to its audience.

            This principle provided an unique challenge for the broadcaster who saw the value
            to audiences of curating content from across the web and bringing it all together in one place.

            The brief for 100 Shapes was to take a sophisticated content-browsing algorithm and use it to power a
            custom interface that would create meaningful music discovery experiences.

            We designed, built and audience-tested a Project Freebird module with its own visual identity that summarises and
            presents a clear balance of music news and criticism. We conducted regular usability testing with members of the target
            audience to make sure that design consistently met the needs of the users.

            Feedback on the recent pilot has been highly positive
            from audiences and stakeholders, and shown that the BBC can offer a quality curatorial service while
            safeguarding its own brand. The BBC is considering other ways Freebird can be applied across its wider
            digital innovation strategy.
