            The decision to feature external music reviews and articles on its own branded platform was a major
            departure for the BBC. Our brief was to take the BBC’s sophisticated new content-browsing algorithm and
            apply it to create meaningful music discovery experiences.

            We designed, built and audience-tested a Freebird module with its own visual identity that summarises and
            presents a clear balance of music news and criticism. Feedback on the recent pilot has been highly positive
            from audiences and stakeholders, and shown that the BBC can offer a quality curatorial service while
            safeguarding its own brand. The BBC is considering other ways Freebird can be applied across its wider
            digital innovation strategy.
