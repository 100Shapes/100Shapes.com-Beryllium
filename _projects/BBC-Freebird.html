    <p>Project Freebird was designed to present external content on the BBC website while staying true to the broadcaster's core principle of balance.</p>
        <p>The decision to feature external msuci reviews and articles on its own branded platformwas a major departure for the BBC. Our brief was to take the BBC's sophisticated new content-browsing algorithm and apply it to create meaningful music discovery experiences.</p>
        <p>We designed, built and audience-tested a Freebird module with its own visual identity that summarises and presents a clear balance of music news and criticism. Feedback on the recent pilot has been highly positive from audiences and stakeholders, and shown that the BBC can offer a quality curatorial service while safeguarding its own brand. The BBC is considering ways Freebird can be applied across its wider digital innovation strategy.</p>
