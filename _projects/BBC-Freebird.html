  Project Freebird was designed to present external content on the BBC website while staying true to the broadcaster’s
  core principle of balance.

            The decision to feature external music reviews and articles on its own branded platform was a major
            departure for the BBC. Our brief was to take the BBC’s sophisticated new content-browsing algorithm and
            apply it to create meaningful music discovery experiences.

            We designed, built and audience-tested a Freebird module with its own visual identity that summarises and
            presents a clear balance of music news and criticism. Feedback on the recent pilot has been highly positive
            from audiences and stakeholders, and shown that the BBC can offer a quality curatorial service while
            safeguarding its own brand. The BBC is considering other ways Freebird can be applied across its wider
            digital innovation strategy.
