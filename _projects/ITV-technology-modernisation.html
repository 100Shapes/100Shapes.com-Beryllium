        <p>In early 2016, 100 Shapes was given a mandate by the ITV Board for the ongoing assessment and improvement of the broadcaster’s internal tools. The result has been an extensive programme of technology modernisation, driven by us, across ITV’s content production, acquisition, sales and distribution systems.</p>

        <p>An embedded team of 100 Shapes designers works closely with ITV staff to identify ways systems can be tweaked, simplified or redesigned. A flexible partnership model allows us to scale services up and down month to month.
        </p>

        <p>Building on established trust, the model frees ITV resource from laborious internal scoping processes. It
            allows us to be proactive, work faster and preempt system issues before they arise, delivering numerous
            efficiencies and ultimately saving money for ITV.</p>
