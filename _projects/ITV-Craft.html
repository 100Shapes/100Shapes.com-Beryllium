        <p>ITV’s Global Entertainment Operations ('GE Ops') team distribute content around the globe, overseeing the
            transfer of files and data to
            other
            broadcasters worldwide. For years they had been hamstrung by legacy tools and convoluted processes that were
            slow, inefficient and error-prone.</p>

        <p>We sat with the team and stepped through their day-to-day processes. To make a difference as quickly as
            possible, we identified one of the worst frustration points and set about rapidly developing and testing a
            new user interface design.</p>

        <p>This became Craft, a ‘translator layer’ that sits over the legacy database and immediately reduced one
            frequent order-fulfilment task from eight minutes to 20 seconds. We’re continuing to add functions to Craft,
            extending its usefulness to other tasks and other departments in the organisation.</p>

        <p>This has been a hugely satisfying project for the 100 Shapes team – a brilliant example of how UX design can
            make people’s daily work lives tangibly better.</p>
