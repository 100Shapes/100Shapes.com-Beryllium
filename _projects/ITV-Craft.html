            ITVs Global Entertainment Operations ('GE Ops') team coordinate the
            distribution of programme content around the globe, overseeing the
            transfer of files and data to other broadcasters worldwide as that content
            is acquired and sold. For years they had been hamstrung by legacy tools and
            systems that were slow, inefficient and error-prone. Training was tedious
            and expensive and an expansion of ITV's content portfolio meant the GE
            OPs team were stretched beyond breaking point.
        </p>
        <p>
            100 Shapes UX &amp; design process begins with user research. We sat
            with the GE team and stepped through their day-to-day processes.
            To make a difference as quickly as possible, we identified one of the worst
            frustration points and set about rapidly developing and testing a
            new user interface design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the design process 100 Shapes conducted iterative usability testing
            to assess the viability of the ideas and ensure that everything they produced met
            the needs of the target audience.
        </p>
        <p>
            This became <em>ITV Craft</em>, a ‘translator layer’ that sits over the legacy databases and immediately reduced one
            frequent order-fulfilment task from eight minutes to 20 seconds. Were continuing to add functions to Craft,
            extending its usefulness to other tasks and other departments in the organisation.
        </p>
        <p>
            This has been a hugely satisfying project for the 100 Shapes team  a brilliant example of how UX design can
            make peoples daily work lives tangibly better.
